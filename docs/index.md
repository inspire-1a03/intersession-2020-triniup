## Day 1: Reflection

            Today was the first day of Module 3, Electronics and the rest of us. We have been tasked with taking a basic Arduino set and transforming it into a Weather station. While the process has been simplified, it still involves many parts and today we focused on getting an introductory grasp on GitHub and how the coding aspect will work. We began by learning the basics of GitHub - what it does, what its advantages are and what uses the program could have. It was quite interesting , i mean; if you were to focus on the big picture applications it would actually be quite handy as GitHub allows to save versions of your program,book, or project and places markers for all and any revisions or versions that you make. This is ideal for those who have specific needs and when troubleshooting - the software allows the user to go line by line or version by version or even revision by revision to see where you would have made any mistakes and then correct. Or even go back and redo altogether while preserving any necessary components you want. i could see a real world application in Medical Sciences or somehting like that where you would need a program to work flawlessly under strict controls while adhering to ethical standards or laws. i am really excited to see where this journey will lead us and how we will exactly get there.   

You're also asked to insert a photo that represents your accomplishments on your first day. Take a photo of you working or one of your circuits and upload it to the /docs/images/ folder of this repository. Then, insert your photo into your document by modifying the markdown example that has been inserted below.

## Day 2: Results
<!--
Upload your fully-commented Arduino sketch from your final Day 2 build task--a thermometer connected to an RDB LED--into your GitHub repository.
Provide a short (~150 words) summary of your work on this circuit:
- How does your device work?
- What was challenging? 
- What worked? What didn't? 
- Be sure to link to your code (in your GitHub repository) in the text of your response.

## Arduino build-off results
<!--
Upload your fully-commented Arduino sketch from the final product of your Arduino build-off into your GitHub repository.
In ~300 words, provide a final device description and product pitch: 
- What does it do? Use a table (created in markdown) to list and describe the features. You can use the template provided below. 
- Describe briefly how it works.
- How could it be used in everyday life (or maybe just in rare cases)? 
- Be sure to link to your code (in your GitHub repository) in the text of your response.
- Include a snippet of code using the ``` ``` characters to display the code properly. 
Finally, record a short (30 second) video of a 'product pitch' for your device. 
- Upload the video to Youtube, and use the sample code below to embed your video.

Below is an example of embedding a YouTube video in a markdown document for use in GitHub pages. 
Note that this video won't show when previewing the document in GitHub--it only works on the GitHub pages webpage. 
- Once your YouTube video is uploaded, right click and select ```<> Copy embed code```. 
- You can paste this code directly into your markdown document. 
- Note that you may want to adjust the width and height parameters to make it fit well in your webpage
